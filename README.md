# AutoMob-Mechanic 🚗

**AutoMob-Mechanic** is a static multi-page web application designed to simulate a simple automobile service and booking platform. This project was built to implement and reinforce core concepts learned during the **Infosys Springboard HTML5 course**.

## 🧑‍💻 Purpose of the Project

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in HTML. It helped me:
- Practise HTML5 tags and form handling
- Understand page linking and structure
- Apply real-world page-building using semantic elements
- Work with attributes like `required`, `pattern`, `placeholder`, `mailto:`, etc.
